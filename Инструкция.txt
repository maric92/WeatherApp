The app displays the temperature on request (in Celsius), and also adds a picture that reflects what the weather is in the city now.
Data is taken from the site https://openweathermap.org/api, by binding a private key and issuing information on request.
Launch - open any project file, then-python manage.py runserver, on the local server, will issue a form.
Also, in addition to the search bar, you can find and add all the cities to the main page through the admin http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/weather/city/
